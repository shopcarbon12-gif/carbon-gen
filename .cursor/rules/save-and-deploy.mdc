# Save and Deploy After Every Change

When you make code changes to this project:

1. **Save** – Stage and commit changes:
   ```
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy** – Deploy to Vercel production:
   ```
   npm run deploy:vercel
   ```
   Or: `npx vercel --prod`

Do both after completing a change. Skip only if the user explicitly says not to (e.g. "don't deploy" or "just the code").
